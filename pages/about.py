        Four years prior, I embarked on a journey as an Operations Analyst, where I implemented agile methodologies and enhanced processes within            the chemical and automotive sectors. Yet, as time progressed, I felt a strong desire for a new beginning. Driven by my love for Data and             storytelling, I enrolled in a 3-month Data Analytics Bootcamp at Ironhack Spain, seeking to pivot my career path.
